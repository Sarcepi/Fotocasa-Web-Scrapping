# Fotocasa-Web-Scrapping and Analysis

This Python project is designed to scrape rental data from Fotocasa.com, a popular real estate website. The project automates the extraction of key information about apartments, such as prices, features, and locations, to build a comprehensive dataset for analysis. The script uses Selenium for dynamic interaction with the website and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. The collected data can be used for market analysis, price prediction models, or visualizations.
